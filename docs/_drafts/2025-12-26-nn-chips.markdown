## Guidelines for DSAs
1. Use dedicated memories to minimize the distance over which data is moved.
2. Invest the resources saved from dropping advanced microarchitectural optimi-
zations into more arithmetic units or bigger memories.
3. Use the easiest form of parallelism that matches the domain.
4. Reduce data size and type to the simplest needed for the domain.
5. Use a domain-specific programming language to port code to the DSA.
