## CUDA tensor

**Partitioning is tiling and/or composition followed by slicing.**



A `Tensor` is represented by two template parameters: `Engine` and `Layout`. 

The `Engine` concept is a wrapper for an iterator or array of data. It uses a stripped-down interface of `std::array` to present the iterator.

### **Tagged Iterators**

用来表示iterator指向的内存空间，比如，是指向SMEM还是GMEM，等





- `Tensor` is defined as an `Engine` and a `Layout`.
  - `Engine` is an iterator that can be offset and dereferenced.
  - `Layout` defines the logical domain of the tensor and maps coordinates to offsets.
- Tile a `Tensor` using the same methods for tiling `Layout`s.
- Slice a `Tensor` to retrieve subtensors.
- Partitioning is tiling and/or composition followed by slicing.

#### Linear Layouts

**injective** (or "one-to-one") describes a property of a linear mapping where every unique input maps to a unique output. In the framework of Linear Layouts, this refers to the relationship between hardware resource bits and logical tensor coordinates.

**surjective** describes a property of a linear mapping where the input resources (such as registers, threads, and warps) **represent the entire logical tensor**

**Bijectivity:** When a layout is both injective and surjective, it is considered a **bijective** (or invertible) mapping
